# João Pedro Fonseca Dantas

## About Me
Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my corner of the internet. My name is João Pedro Fonseca Dantas, and I’m a passionate backend developer with a love for crafting efficient, clean, and scalable solutions. But before we dive into my professional side, let’s start at the beginning.

I was born in 2001 in the sunny city of Natal, RN, Brazil, but most of my childhood memories are rooted in the charming country town of Caicó, RN. Growing up there, I developed a curious mind and an eagerness to tinker with how things work—a trait that would eventually lead me to the world of programming.

## My Journey Into Tech
In high school, I studied Electrotechnics at IFRN (Federal Institute of Rio Grande do Norte). It was there that I discovered programming—and it was love at first line of code. This discovery set me on a path that would shape my life.

In 2020, I embarked on the next step of my journey by joining UFRN (Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte) to pursue a bachelor’s degree in IT. Around the same time, I began exploring professional opportunities, starting as an intern at ESIG in 2021, where I learned the ropes of real-world development.

In 2022, I joined Itaú Unibanco, one of Brazil's leading banks, as a junior software engineer. By early 2024, I was thrilled to be promoted to mid-level software engineer, continuing to grow my skills and take on exciting challenges.

## What I’m Passionate About

* **💻 Programming Best Practices:** I’m always on the hunt for ways to write better, cleaner, and more maintainable code. I’m a huge fan of Clean Architecture (shoutout to Uncle Bob!).
* **🐧 Linux Enthusiast:** I’m proud to say I’m a Linux lover. My distro of choice? Fedora Linux, for its simplicity and power.
* **🌐 Open Source Contributions:** Giving back to the community is important to me. I actively contribute to Apache Kafka, a project I deeply admire.
* **📚 Literature Lover:** When I’m not coding, I’m often lost in the pages of a great novel. Literature is my go-to escape and source of inspiration.
* **♟ Chess Enthusiast:** I enjoy the strategic challenges of chess—it’s like debugging, but on a board!

## Why This Blog?
This blog is my way of documenting my journey, sharing what I’m learning, and connecting with like-minded people. Whether it’s a deep dive into backend development, tips on Clean Architecture, or stories from my open-source adventures, I want this space to be equal parts educational and enjoyable.

## Outside the Code
When I’m not glued to my screen, you can usually find me geeking out over tech innovations, exploring new programming concepts, diving into a great book, or challenging myself in a game of chess.
